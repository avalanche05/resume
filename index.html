								As a product designer working at the apex of new tech, I’m
								fascinated by how design decisions influence user interactions
								with products. When approaching a new project, my aim is to make
								product integration into consumer experiences as seamless as
								possible.

								Working with me means working with someone dedicated to finding
								the most creative answers to design problems. I’m never content
								going with an established way of doing things when it’s possible
								to innovate.
